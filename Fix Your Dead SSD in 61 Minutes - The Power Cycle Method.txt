There was a big dustup a while ago about power failures killing SSDs
<https://dfarq.homeip.net/an-ssd-data-loss-issue-and-how-to-prevent-it/
>. It turns out that when this happens, you can usually unbrick it. If
your SSD died, here’s how to recover or fix your dead SSD in 61 minutes
using the power cycle method.

Yes, it really does take 61 minutes to revive a dead SSD, but you only
have direct involvement for a few minutes. The rest of the time, you can
do something else while you wait for the drive to do its thing. This
trick will even let you recover drives that won’t show up in Windows
Device Manager or disk management if you transplant them into another
machine.

Note that this trick generally only works for drives corrupted by power
loss. But it doesn’t hurt to try it on any old dead drive, say one
corrupted by a bad firmware update or a blue screen. It’s nice that it’s
possible to recover from SSD failure using a free, easy trick. First
I’ll cover SATA drives, then I’ll cover a trick that works for NVMe and
M.2 drives.

    SSD repair without tools: What you need

The SSD power cycle trick works better in a desktop PC, since you need
to connect the power cable but not the data cable. If you’re recovering
a drive from a laptop, you can use a spare power supply with my neato
paper clip trick <https://dfarq.homeip.net/a-safe-way-to-test-power-
supplies/>. Then you don’t have to open up an extra computer.

If a laptop is all you have, you can use a USB SATA adapter as long as
it’s possible to plug in just the power cable. My USB SATA adapters use
a single connector. Or you can try the alternate method below that works
on NVMe or M.2 SSDs.

    Power cycle the SSD to fix it

Fix your dead SSD with the power cycle method <https://dfarq.homeip.net/
fix-dead-ssd/unplug-sata-data-cable/>
To fix your dead SSD with this method, unplug the SATA data cable from
the SSD, like I’m doing here. The data cable is the smaller of the two.
Then cycle the power as I describe in the paragraph to the left.

If the SSD is already in a desktop computer, pull the data cable, but
not the power cable.

If you’re installing the SSD in a desktop or connecting it to a loose
power supply temporarily, do this instead. Connect the power cable, but
no data cable, to the SSD. The power cable is the larger of the two
connectors.

Turn on the power and leave the power on for 30 minutes. After 30
minutes, power down or pull the power cable. Wait 30 seconds, then
restore power. Let the drive sit powered on for another 30 minutes.
Power down again, then wait 30 seconds.

At that point, if all went well, the drive will come back to life when
you connect the data cable, or plug the drive back into a laptop.

    What about an NVMe or M.2 SSD?

Of course, if you have an NVMe or M.2 SSD, you can’t unplug the data
connection while leaving the power connection in like you can with SATA.
You’ll need to use the alternative method below to fix your dead SSD of
the NVMe or M.2 type.

Back to the table of contents <#toc>


    The alternate method

Supposedly this trick can work without disassembling anything at all. If
it’s a PC, turn the PC on and then hit whatever key boots the PC into
the BIOS. Frequently it’s the DEL key or one of the function keys like
F1, F2, F8 or F10. Let it sit for 30 minutes at the BIOS screen, then
power down for 30 seconds and repeat.

On a Mac, power up while you hold down the ALT key, which is supposed to
pull up a boot menu. Let it sit at the boot menu for 30 minutes, then
power down for 30 seconds and repeat.

Back to the table of contents <#toc>


    One more thing to try in Dell laptops

In Dell laptops and possibly others, the smaller size of SATA SSDs
compared to traditional hard drives can cause electrical contact issues.
If your SSD suddenly died in a computer like that, you can probably fix
it by shimming it with an old gift card <https://dfarq.homeip.net/ssd-
not-detected-in-bios-try-this/>. Try that if the power cycle trick
doesn’t work. Or feel free to try it first.

Back to the table of contents <#toc>


    A last resort to fix a dead SSD

And as a last resort, sometimes an SSD will overheat and break one or
more solder joints. You can fix that issue by baking an SSD in an oven
<https://dfarq.homeip.net/baking-ssds-the-ssd-oven-trick/> to reflow its
solder joints. This issue is rather rare though, so it’s a last resort.

Back to the table of contents <#toc>


    Possible residual issues

Once you get the drive working, you could still have problems that keep
it from booting, so you may have to do some further data recovery. But
recovering data in those cases isn’t as hard as it sounds.

If you have a Missing Operating System error or a similar indication of
an MBR problem, here’s how to rebuild an MBR and recover partitions
<https://dfarq.homeip.net/how-to-clean-an-mbr-and-recover-drive-
partitions/>. The MBR trick will also recover the file system after it
rebuilds the MBR. If the system appears to work but goes into a loop,
here’s how to fix a Windows boot loop <https://dfarq.homeip.net/fix-a-
windows-boot-loop-with-ahci/>. All using free tools of course.

I also have a trick for fixing SD and micro SD cards <https://
dfarq.homeip.net/my-phones-micro-sd-card-made-windows-disk-manager-hang-
but-i-fixed-it/>, if you’re interested.

Using one or more of the tricks above will restore your system to a
bootable state and get your lost data back.

Back to the table of contents <#toc>


    Fix your dead SSD with the power cycle method: In conclusion

There are no guarantees, and the trick sounds a lot like MacGyver or
even witchcraft. But this works often enough that many people now do it
routinely. If the drive isn’t working, you don’t have anything to lose
by trying to fix your SSD this way. Unlike some data loss tricks we used
to do with hard drives, this one does no harm.

This DIY SSD drive repair trick works with most drives. I’m familiar
with it working with Crucial, Samsung, and OCZ drives. Even if you have
a different brand, it’s worth a try with other makes of drive as well.

And aside from the power loss weakness, SSDs tend to outlive their
advertised life expectancy <https://dfarq.homeip.net/what-happens-when-
you-write-a-petabyte-of-data-to-an-ssd/>. So it’s good to be able to
bring one back when it dies from power loss.

The right answer, of course, is to have backup copies so you can restore
data from a backup if something goes wrong. But your backup won’t fix a
nonfunctioning drive, so it’s nice to be able to bring bricked hardware
back from the deadm, usually with data intact.

            I always recommend a desktop if at all possible. With a
            desktop power supply, you know for certain that the data
            isn’t plugged in, and you know the drive is getting power. A
            lot less uncertainty that way.

    I recently built a new desktop with a fresh Windows 10 install. I
    bought Samsung’s 960 Pro 1TB and it worked just fine. It is plugged
    into the M.2 slot that is located on the Motherboard. I had to plug
    it directly in using a half casing that the ASUS Prime X399-A
    motherboard came with. I was configuring software at the time and my
    computer crashed to the Windows 10 version of the blue screen of
    death. After gathering information for a restart it then went black
    screen and just hung there so I forced the computer to shut down by
    holding the power button. After powering it back on the M.2 SSD does
    not exist within the BIOS and since the stick is plugged directly
    into the motherboard I am unsure how I could go about the power
    cycling method as it is an internal SSD. Sometimes when I power the
    computer on now the Monitor states that there is no DisplayPort
    Signal as well making it difficult to perform the Power Cycle for
    the M.2 SSD. I was wondering if you may have any ideas. I am
    desperate as I had zero chance to back anything up and my school
    documents had just been transferred over. My old desktop is way too
    out of date to even attempt to plug the M.2 slot into it, being
    built back when Vista was commonplace. After having seen that SSDs
    are regularly disappearing from people’s BIOS, I assumed that it was
    common knowledge so I contacted Samsung for a possible fix and they
    are telling me that it is not common at all and that the only fix is
    to RMA it to them to be repaired or replaced. Any help would be
    greatly appreciated and thank you ahead of time.

        Try the alternate method outlined above, booting into the BIOS
        or UEFI for about 30 minutes instead of power cycling. I haven’t
        tried this myself but have heard it sometimes works. Let me know
        how it goes, if you would.

    I have a Nvme M2 Samsung 960 EVO that always disappeared but after a
    restart/shutdown it worked again, in the last 3 months it worked
    flawlessly. Since yesterday it disappeared and never returned.

    I tried your method but after starting the computer it hangs in the
    boot window, so I press DEL and after 15 minutes it goes into BIOS
    where I see the 960 EVO 1TB, the thing is when I boot back into
    Windows it disappears.

    What should I do? I tried to leave it 2 times around 20minutes, but
    same thing, I see it in BIOS but not in Windows. At this point I
    just want to be able to see it once more so I can back up the rest
    of the things and send it back to Samsung.

    Thanks for your post it was a starting point.

        If it shows up in the BIOS but not Windows, it may be filesystem
        or partition table corruption. Click Start, then start typing
        Disk Management, and run whichever comes up (it varies based on
        what version of Windows you’re running.) If you can see the SSD
        there, I would suggest giving this a try: https://
        dfarq.homeip.net/mbr-rootkits-dont-mean-you-have-to-wipe-the-
        drive/ <https://dfarq.homeip.net/mbr-rootkits-dont-mean-you-
        have-to-wipe-the-drive/>

        The good news is, if it’s a filesystem or partition table issue,
        once you fix that, there’s probably no need to send it to Samsung.

            Thanks for your reply. The thing is it does not appear in
            Disk Management. Only every now and then I can see in the
            Device Manager, Nvme controller with an exclamation mark
            next to it. Some times it does not appear at all in Device
            Manager. I also tried to get Samsung’s bootable ISO firmware
            but it scans for Nvme SSDs and then it exits.

            I tried it on an Intel NUC as well and same story. I also
            bought a PCIe adapter but still it does not appear. That’s
            my goal to get it to show up in Disk Management in order to
            somehow save it.

                The only other thing I can think of, and it’s a bit of a
                long shot, would be reflowing the solder in the oven.
                The downside with that is that is it will void your
                warranty. https://dfarq.homeip.net/baking-ssds-the-ssd-

    I’m amazed that this method actually works, but it does seem to. I
    had a 1TB Samsung mSATA SSD in my laptop, which all of a sudden one
    morning the laptop could not see anymore, “boot device not found”.
    Using this technique revived it, I was able to restore a backup
    image onto it, and it’s been working for a few weeks now. So thanks
    for the info.

    However in my case the failure can’t have been due to a power
    failure, since it was in a laptop with a working battery, and in any
    case no power failure occurred. But since the same technique fixed
    the drive, that tends to indicate it might be the same failure mode.
    I would dearly like to know what the true cause of these failures
    is, and what state the failed drives are actually in, but I guess
    only the manufacturers would be able to do the necessary internal
    diagnostics to tell us that.

    Have a OCZ Trion 100 which doesn’t show in the BIOS. After a BSOD it
    rebooted and said that there was no boot drive.
    Have tried the power option on a PC 3x times but still not working.
    Anymore suggestions or is the drive completely dead.

    Glad I came across this post, almost gave up – let’s have one more go 🙂

    Would this work with a telephone charger USB/netpower plug?
    My crashed Crucial M500 SSD takes 5V 1.7A, and I bought a SATA to
    USB cable to try it on a Linux computer etc.

        I’m not sure but it’s worth a try. If not, try it from an
        internal SATA port.

    tried this method hoping to revive a sandisk 64gb… and the ssd got
    recognised! (I have already another ssd as main and a hdd too), so
    naturally…I booted the system and…infinite loop! After I removed the
    sandisk ssd then I booted normally, I guess it is beyond saving

        Maybe try it in a USB enclosure and plug it in after it boots.
        It may be readable if you plug it in after boot time.

        Since your issue is intermittent, it sounds more like a
        mechanical connection issue. Try changing the SATA cable if this
        is a desktop (and switch to a different power connector if you
        can), or if it’s a laptop, shimming the drive with a piece of
        plastic, which I cover in one of the links at the end.

        Running the power without data is the key. If you don’t have a
        way to do that, I’d recommend finding a friend who has a desktop
        PC so you can hook it up to that. Or try the alternate method
        with booting the machine into the BIOS.

    My SSD died within 13 month of laptop life. Since it is m.2
    interface i used the alternative method. But unfortunately didn’t
    work for me.
    I will try again tomorrow.

    Didn’t work for me sadly, tried both methods, plugging only the
    power cable and the method for m.2, respectively. Still appreciate
    the effort, I will try it on another PC when I will have more spare
    time.

    i keep power cycling for 30 mins over and over but it won’t come
    back. i tried different power connectors and a USB adapter to my
    laptop but no dice.my ssd was open in Windows for a bit when it went
    to BSOD. Before that this all started with a power outage. Am I screwed?

        Chris, your drive sounds like a good candidate for this
        recovery. The key is making sure the data cable isn’t connected,
        if at all possible. You might try borrowing an ATX power supply
        if you don’t have one. Failing that, perhaps your drive’s
        manufacturer has an idea. The trick works more often than not
        but sometimes requires some tinkering, and, unfortunately,
        sometimes it doesn’t work.

    I am trying to revive a SP S55 ssd. It stopped working when my
    battery backup went bad causing abrupt power cycles. I have tried
    this method before a few months ago without success. I will try
    again. Is there any problem running longer power cycles? Could more
    cycles make a difference?

        There is no harm in trying longer or a larger number of cycles.
        Good luck.

    Wow, this is awesome, tried just about everything else then came
    across this post.
    It worked for me as well, BIOS now detect my M550 with a BUT.

    My intel D915GAG mainboard shows error 109, the SATA settings for
    this drive is set to auto BUT shows up as 0MB even thought the mSATA
    device is a Micron M550 64GB.

    Would you by any chance a have a suggestion on a remedy, as I cannot
    get to my boot disk to try and begin the rest of the repair process.
