# Error code : Bad System Config info
https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/windows-11-bad-system-config-info.3718971/#post-22422791

This issue occurs because the Bootcat.cache file is corrupted or because the size of the Bootcat.cache file is changed since the last successful start.

Note The Bootcat.cache file is located at %SystemRoot%\system32\codeintegrity.

To work around this issue, start the computer from the disc drive or from the USB drive by using the Windows installation media. Delete the Bootcat.cache file, and then restart the computer.
