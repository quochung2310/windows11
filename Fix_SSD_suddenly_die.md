SSD repair without tools: What you need

The SSD power cycle trick works better in a desktop PC, since you need to connect the power cable but not the data cable.
If you’re recovering a drive from a laptop, you can use a spare power supply with my neato paper clip trick. 
Then you don’t have to open up an extra computer.

If a laptop is all you have, you can use a USB SATA adapter as long as it’s possible to plug in just the power cable.
My USB SATA adapters use a single connector. Or you can try the alternate method below that works on NVMe or M.2 SSDs.

# Power cycle the SSD to fix it
 Fix your dead SSD with the power cycle method

If the SSD is already in a desktop computer, pull the data cable, but not the power cable.

If you’re installing the SSD in a desktop or connecting it to a loose power supply temporarily, do this instead. Connect the power cable, but no data cable, to the SSD. The power cable is the larger of the two connectors.

Turn on the power and leave the power on for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, power down or pull the power cable. Wait 30 seconds, then restore power. Let the drive sit powered on for another 30 minutes. Power down again, then wait 30 seconds.

At that point, if all went well, the drive will come back to life when you connect the data cable, or plug the drive back into a laptop.
